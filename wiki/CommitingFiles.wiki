#summary So you've made some changes...

= Introduction =

So you've made some changes to the game and you need to commit, well the files you modified aren't in the tortise folder so you'll need to move them over.

= Details =

The easiest way to do this is to open both file locations, both the tileEngine folder in the tortise folder and the tileEngine project folder in visual studio's project folder.

Once there, you have to move all files you've modified to their respective locations within the tortise folder. Don't remember what you modified? For shame! You'll have to move everything!

Start in the tileEngine folder since it is the first folder. Go to Content and copy over Maps and Textures. Then back in the main folder, all .cs files should be copied over.

The same must be done for all other files in the other two folders. Just remember, all .cs and resource files must be moved. Resourse files are .xml, texture, and similar files.

*NOTE* any files you do not commit will screw up EVERYTHING.
